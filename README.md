Parametric mount for attaching a cylindrical flashlight to those sliding
handlebar grips that come with many bike lights (such as [this
one](http://www.tesco.com/direct/via-velo-white-led-mini-front-light/729-9776.prd?pageLevel=&skuId=729-9776)).
The first print came out slightly small, so I had to file both it and the rail
down, but that may have been a printer miscalibration error. After that it's
worked fine (at least so far), so I'm putting it out to the world in its
current state.

Instructions
------------

1. Measure your slide ([here's one](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cateye-Flex-Tight-Bracket-22-32/dp/B000P1PZUY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1363348368&sr=8-7) if you don't have one already).
2. Customize the SCAD file, either by hand or using the Thingiverse Customizer.
3. Print your mount.
4. If necessary, file it down until it fits.
5. Insert the flashlight, possibly wrapping it in some padding with a bit of give (rubber, duct tape, etc).
6. Insert 1-3 nuts and bolts into the holes in the flanges and tighten until the flashlight doesn't move.
7. Attach the mount to the rail.
8. Attach the rail to the bike.
9. Turn off your computer and printer and go outside for a bike ride.
